        <h1>Come Undone 終將打開</h1>
<h2>獨白</h2>
<p>我這一生從未錯得如此過。</p>
<p>I had never been so wrong before in my life.</p>
<p>僅僅因為我不能分享我呼吸的空氣</p>
<p>我那張逐漸下垂的笑臉就多了條煩惱的皺紋</p>
<p>For the fact alone that I couldn't share the air I breathed</p>
<p>brought an agonizing twitch in my slowly sinking smile.</p>
<p>儘管這聽起來很荒唐，我哭了。</p>
<p>I would go as far as to say, I started to cry.</p>
<p>我也只剩下哭了。</p>
<p>And that's just what I did.</p>
<p>轉瞬間，我明白了，把自己關在這裡</p>
<p>是個粗魯的決定，</p>
<p>Right then I had realized that trapping myself here</p>
<p>was a rather rash decision,</p>
<p>而命運不會容忍我。</p>
<p>and would not be tolerated by fate.</p>
<p>我的朋友沒了，如此，我的笑容也是。</p>
<p>My friends were gone, and therefore, so is my smile.</p>
<p>我向身旁的星星訴苦，但它們不回應。</p>
<p>I expressed my sorrow to the stars around me, but they wouldn't respond.</p>
<p>它們甚至不知道我的存在。</p>
<p>They didn't even acknowledge my presence.</p>
<p>朋友會，但我已經沒有了。</p>
<p>Friends would, but I didn't have those anymore.</p>
<p>我又哭了。</p>
<p>I cried again.</p>
<h2>副歌</h2>
<p>風暴席捲，在這牆內。</p>
<p>The storm is raging inside these walls.</p>
<p>心上打的詰，終將打開。</p>
<p>The knots of emotion will come undone.</p>
<p>終將打開。</p>
<p>Come undone.</p>
<p>終將打開。</p>
<p>Come undone.</p>
