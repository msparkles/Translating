# Apples to the Core 心是蘋果核

## 前奏

(Applejack)

來吧，蘋果們，這首咱都知道！

C'mon, Apples, y'all know this one!



(Granny Smith)

爽啦！

Hot-diggity!



(Applejack)

噫－－哈！

Yee-haw!



(Big McIntosh)

噫－－耶。

Eeyup.

## 主歌-1

我們在世代的路上旅行

大家都有某種特質

We've traveled the road of generations

joined by a common bond



我們在小馬國度間唱歌

Equestria 裡裡外外

We sing our song 'cross the pony nation

from Equestria and beyond

## 副歌

我們永遠是蘋果，團結的蘋果

我們是家庭，但不只這樣而已

We're Apples forever, Apples together

We're family, but so much more



不管刮風下雨，我們都會面對

我們的心是蘋果核

No matter what comes, we will face the weather

We're Apples to the core



噫－－耶。

Eeyup.

## 主歌-2

我不會想要去其他地方

跟家人旅行就已經最棒

There's no place that I'd rather be

than travelin' with my family



親朋好友都會一起加入

一起唱歌到盡頭

Friends all around come to join and see

as we sing out across the land

## 重複: 副歌

// WIP HERE

## 主歌-3

We're peas in a pod, we're thick as thieves

Any cliché you can throw at me

We're here for each other, through thick and thin

You're always welcome with your Apple kin

Wheeeeee!

You're more fun than the color pink

Or balloons flying over your favorite drink

The love I feel here is swim, not sink

As we party across this land

All right!

We're Apples forever, Apples together

We're family, but so much more

No matter what comes, we will face the weather

We're Apples to the core!

Eeyup!
