# Giggle at the Ghosties 對鬼兒來個嘻嘻

## 前奏

噢，女孩們，你們不知道？

Oh girls, don't you see?

## 主歌-1

當我還是個小小馬，太陽正在下山...

When I was a little filly and the sun was going down...



> 拜託，她不要是...

> Tell me she's not...



那些黑暗跟影子們，總是讓我傷心...

The darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown...



> 她是。

> She is.



我會躲在枕頭下

躲著我想像的東西

I'd hide under my pillow

from what I thought I saw



但奶奶派說不應該這樣

處理你的恐懼

But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way

to deal with fears at all



> 那應該怎樣？

> Then what is?

## 導歌

她說：「Pinkie，你要挺起身

學會面對恐懼

你會知道，他們不能傷害你

就笑一笑他們就消失了。」

She said, "Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall

Learn to face your fears

You'll see that they can't hurt you

Just laugh to make them disappear."



哈！哈！哈！

Ha! Ha! Ha!

## 副歌

所以，對鬼兒來個嘻嘻

醜兒來個哈哈

So, giggle at the ghostly

Guffaw at the grossly



大笑面對噁東西

給哭臉開個派對

Crack up at the creepy

Whoop it up with the weepy



怪人給他噗嗤

嚇人給他鼾鼻

Chortle at the kooky

Snortle at the spooky



然後跟那個大大的嚇人臉說叫他去健走不要來煩你要是他覺得他有辦法嚇倒你然後他還有另外一招然後光是這樣想你就很想... 哈哈哈... 呵...

And tell that big dumb scary face to take a hike and leave you alone and if he thinks he can scare you then he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just makes you wanna... hahahaha... heh...



笑～～～～～～～

Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuugh!
