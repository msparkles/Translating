# Art of the Dress 服裝藝術

## 主歌-1

一針一線，好好縫在一塊

Twilight 的衣服，用剪刀剪出輪廓

Thread by thread, stitching it together

Twilight's dress, cutting out the pattern snip by snip



確保布料都沒有皺褶

連顏色都如此時尚且完美

Making sure the fabric folds nicely

It's the perfect color and so hip



要好好一步一步來

確保線有縫對方向

Always gotta keep in mind my pacing

Making sure the clothes' correctly facing



這是 Twilight 的衣服

I'm stitching Twilight's dress



一尺一寸，要注意好細節

珠寶項鍊，你不知道針要趕快補？

Yard by yard, fussing on the details

Jewel neckline, don't you know a stitch in time saves nine?



給她我最完美的選擇

就算她討厭正式裝扮

Make her something perfect to inspire

even though she hates formal attire



我要做到細緻入微

雖然她更在意衣服多少錢

Gotta mind those intimate details

even though she's more concerned with sales



這是 Applejack 的新衣服

It's Applejack's new dress



裁縫沒有很難，Pinkie Pie 就來點粉紅色

給 Fluttershy 點輕飄飄的設計

Dressmaking is easy, for Pinkie Pie something pink

Fluttershy something breezy



顏色溶入衣服

你會不會覺得這很俗？

Blend color and form,

do you think it looks cheesy?



來點傲氣，也許來些豔麗

勾在一起，你覺不覺得超好看？

Something brash, perhaps quite fetching

Hook and eye, couldn't you just simply die?



要能對上她的頭型

別忘了多加點魔法

Making sure it fits forelock and crest

Don't forget some magic in the dress



雖然會露出屁股

整個衣服卻顯得更活潑

Even though it rides high on the flank,

Rainbow won't look like a tank



這是 Rainbow 的衣服

I'm stitching Rainbow's dress

## 副歌-1

一拚一剪，一剪一拚

Piece by piece, snip by snip



從頭到腳，按部就班

Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip



一針一線，燙好燙平

Thread by thread, primmed and pressed



一尺一寸，不曾困難

Yard by yard, never stressed



這就是服裝藝術！

And that's the art of the dress!

## 對話: Twilight

我說啊，衣服上的星座都要完全正確

獵戶座的腰帶有三顆星星，不是四顆

Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate

Orion has three stars on his belt, not four

## 主歌-2

一縫一紉，好好縫在一塊

沒多少時間，你不知道顧客永遠都是對的？

Stitch by stitch, stitching it together

Deadline looms, don't you know the client's always right?



就算我一切都計畫好了

也要在今晚前做好才行

Even if my fabric choice was perfect

gotta get them all done by tonight



Pinkie Pie, 那個顏色太亮了

不信你拿到光源底下看看

Pinkie Pie, that color's too obtrusive

Wait until you see it in the light



我得快點縫出成品

I'm sewing them together!

## 對話: Pinkie Pie

你不覺得加點棒棒糖

會更有我的風格嗎？

Don't you think my gown

would be more "me" with some lollipops?



> 嗯，我覺得...

> Well, I think...



氣球？

Balloons?



> 額...

> Well...



做就對了！

Do it!

## 橋段

一分一秒，更多修改

我要趕快縫好，沒時間了

Hour by hour, one more change

I'm sewing them together, take great pains



Fluttershy, 你讓我頭很大

Rainbow Dash, 你到底想要怎樣

Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind

Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind?



天哪，時間真的不多了

別忘了，Applejack 的衣服一定要有特色

Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time

Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine



裁縫沒有很難，可是顧客的要求

總讓我要重新設計

Dressmaking's easy, every customer's call

brings a whole new revision



我要加快腳步，現在還不能睡覺

Have to pick up the pace, still hold to my vision

## 對話

### Twilight

那個不是小犬座，是大犬座

That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor

### Fluttershy

可以給我高定嗎？

French haute couture, please

### Applejack

下雨怎麼辦？雨鞋好了！

What if it rains? Galoshes!

### Pinkie Pie

多一點氣球！不對，太多氣球了

More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons



更多糖果！喔，少點糖果

More candy! Oh, less candy



哦等等，我知道了，彩帶！

Oh wait, I know. Streamers!



> 彩帶

> Streamers?



這是誰的衣服？

Whose dress is this?



> 那就彩帶吧...

> Streamers it is...

### Rainbow Dash

怎樣？

What?



> 你沒有要跟我講哪邊要改嗎？

> Aren't you going to tell me to change something, too?



不用，我只要看起來很酷就好

No, I just want my dress to be cool



> 造型怎麼樣？

> Do you not like the color?



顏色沒問題，酷一點就好

The color's fine, just make it look cooler



> 顏色怎麼樣？

> Do you not like the shape?



造型沒問題，你就讓整個東西...

The shape's fine, just make the whole thing...



你知道的，酷一點

you know, cooler



(停頓)
(pause)



至少再酷個 20% 之類的

It needs to be about twenty percent cooler

## 橋段-2

我們就是猶豫不決

我們只知道喜歡就好

All we ever want is indecision

All we really like is what we know



要在時尚跟規矩間取平衡

至少穿上去要好看

Gotta balance style with adherence

Making sure we make a good appearance



就算成品不怎麼樣

也不可以超出預算

Even if you simply have to fudge it

Make sure that it stays within our budget



沒有時間怕東怕西

這些東西還要出去見人！

Got to overcome intimidation

Remember, it's all in the presentation!

## 副歌-2

一拚一剪，一剪一拚

Piece by piece, snip by snip



從頭到腳，按部就班

Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip



一修一補，燙好燙平

Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed



一尺一寸，如此困難

Yard by yard, always stressed



這就是服裝藝術！

And that's the art of the dress!
