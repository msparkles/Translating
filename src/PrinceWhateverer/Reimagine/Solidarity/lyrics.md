# Solidarity (In This Together) 團結（一起在這兒）

## 前奏

（我們一起在這兒！）

(We're in this together!)

## 主歌-1

回頭看看，心中不禁歎氣

我未曾想過我會如此在意這些

Looking back feels so bittersweet

I'd never imagine what we started could mean so much to me



浪潮退去，我是覺得也許

想說啥就說吧，反正我不相信

It might be true we've passed the golden years

Well let them say what they want, I'll politely disagree



有何重要的呢

都到了心中所想之地

'Cause it doesn't mean much

if you're where you wanna be



大吼吧，如果你仍在外頭

So scream if you're out there



如果事情就是不公

if things just ain't fair



獨自承受著噩夢

Alone in a nightmare



我們不會拋下你

We're not going anywhere

## 導歌

別跟我說它已完結

別說事情都有終點

Don't tell me it's over,

that all things have to end



也許我們會得到永生

看看，我們一起在這裡

I think we'll live forever

'cause we're in this together

## 副歌

(嘿！) 你說，我們接下來要怎麼走

(Hey!) Tell me where do we go from here



(嘿！) 我們會不會就這樣灰飛煙滅

(Hey!) Do we just burn up and disappear



(嘿！) 你是否還會像那樣在我身邊

(Hey!) Will you still be there stood next to me



(嘿！) 就好像 2013 年那樣

(Hey!) Like you were back in 2013

## 主歌-2

他們會不會記得你，在你死了之後

Will they remember you, when you're dead and gone



就讓他們問你的生平

給他們看你一直在這裡

Let them ask you where you were

Show them you've been here all along



你還會不會記得我，在這麼久之後

Will you remember me, when it's been so long



我們會不會消失在腦海裡

下個馬展能不能見面？

Will we fade to distant memories

Will I see you at the con?

## 主歌-3

每次我回頭，看看我們不遠的故鄉

Every time I look back at the place we all came from



熟悉的臉是一張一張

大家都在繼續往前走

Familiar faces one by one

Seems everypony's movin' on



每次我往前，感覺都像有誰被遺落

Every step I take feels like someone gets left behind



決定如此也是沒關係

我們會這樣薪火相傳

But it's their choice and that's okay

We'll keep that fire burning bright

## 橋段 (Twilight's Speech)

Now, on a day like today, I can honestly say,

I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the friendships I've made with all of you.

Each one of you taught me something about friendship...

and for that, I will always be grateful.

Today, I consider myself the luckiest pony in Equestria.

Thank you, friends. Thank you, everypony

## 尾奏

你會不會記得他們，和他們的友誼

Will you remember them, the friendship that they found



你會不會記得這首歌怎麼唱，

二十年之後

Will you know the songs and sing along,

twenty years from now



而你會不會在這裡，跟著我大聲吼

我知道我哪都不會去，至死也是馬圈一分子

Or will you still be here, screaming every word

I know I'm not going anywhere, I'll die with the herd
