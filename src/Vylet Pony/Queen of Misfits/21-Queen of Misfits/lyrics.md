# Queen of Misfits 錯位女王

## 前奏

## 主歌-1

噢，多麼心痛

當你又用沒事般的口氣訓我

Oh, it's murder

the way you tell me off like it's alright



即使你如何難過

仍給我力氣繼續

and even at your worst

you strengthen my will to fight



你不知道你看上了什麼貨色

And you don't know what you're getting into



我回到家裡最是舒服

I'm feeling right right at home

## 副歌-B

我就是錯位女王

是你的夢中情人

'Cause I'm the queen of misfits

I'm the stuff of your dreams



我是自己導演

眼見不就為真

'Cause I declare who I am

Everything's not as seems



我要對你施魔咒

不管你接不接受

I'm gonna put a spell on you

and it's a dazzling truth



我會自己找到路

你的存在無所謂

And I can find my way

with or without you

## 導歌

給我聽好

我們要變得家喻戶曉

So hear our call

We're tryna make a name for ourselves



你們曾有機會能跟我

跟我和好

There was a chance that you and I

would be ok

## 副歌-A

我就是錯位女王

他媽不管你怎麼講

'Cause I'm the queen of misfits

don't give a fuck what you say



我是個超級巨星

得要設法出道

'Cause I'm a superstar

gotta find my own way



本公主很有風度

跟你說我自有計謀

'Cause I'm the princess of style

I got some tricks up my sleeve



我要把你給趕出去

我要好好地做自己

And I'm running you outta town

I gotta be who I wanna be

## 主歌-2

現在看看我們

抹掉剛剛的淚水

Take a look at us now

had to cry for a bit



又回到了最佳狀態

即使看到罪過投影

but now we're back on our best

while you projected the sin



我們在這曾如火燒

現在有差多少？

There was hell for us here before

what's the difference from now?



我們得自己找出路

我們迷路，卻找到彼此

We had to try and find our way

We were lost but then were found



我們心裡都有個壞人

不過是要個朋友

And there's a villain in all of us

still needed a friend



每分每秒都是機會

來償還以前罪行

When every moment's a chance for us

to make all our amends



這從一開始就很困難

從來就沒簡單過

And it's hard since the start of it

It's never been easy



你以為我們失去的魔法

我們靠彼此找回來

And the magic you thought we'd lost

It took ourselves while you turned away
