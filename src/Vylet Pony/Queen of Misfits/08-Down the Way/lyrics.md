# Down the Way 路途中

## 前奏

這忙碌的城鎮

我眼珠轉不來

This busy city

blurs so swiftly by



生命的交響曲

又一天開始

Symphonies of lifetimes

The new day arrives



而我又停不住回想，我們從前

And I can't stop from thinking about who we were



以為我知道家的處所

不在這，不在那

Thought I had known where home was

not here, nor there

## 主歌-1

而我也大可繼續夢想，以前過得怎樣

And I can spend my time dreaming of the things that used to be



或繼續走這條長途

一直在我眼前

or travel down this long path

that's been out before me



而邊走邊看烏鴉，在路途中

And going as the crow flies down the way



我們的旅途從未終點，還有更多

our journey's never over, still follow down

## 間奏

## 主歌-2

對方還有個世界

它，我知道

There's another world over

One that I know



我心中，我一直都在那頭

我總想飛去那

In my mind, I've always been there

how I've tried to go

## 橋段

每份記憶

過往的無數條痕

Every memory

residues of the moments



那道平靜，消失去

而我看向一片晴天

As that stillness passes by

and I look towards an open sky

## 間奏

## 重複: 主歌-1
