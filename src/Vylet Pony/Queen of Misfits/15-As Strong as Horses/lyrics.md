# As Strong as Horses 心如成駒

## 前奏

通常大家就叫我崔希～

Usually ponies just call me Trixie~



但「神通小姐」聽起來也不錯。

But "Miss Powerful" has a nice ring to it.

## 主歌-1

不要放我走

請你永遠都不要放我離去

Please don't make me go

please don't ever make me go away from you



不知我是誰

我真的不知我是誰，或能做什麼

Don't know who I am

I don't really know who I am, or can be



而每個小馬，都跟我說

就停下來，正常一次好

And everypony tries to tell me

to settle down and conform for once



我只跟他們說，他們沒過

其物的夢想

But I just tell them they've never had

dreams of something else

## 副歌

心如成駒，站直直

不論我們為何

As strong as horses we stand tall

no matter who we are



如此幼稚的情感

但幼駒也看得遠

A sentiment so childlike

but a filly can see as far



心如成駒，如成駒

跟天空一樣的清澈

As strong as horses, strong as horses

as clear as the open skies



我不想長大

我不想要長大

我努力好久

I don't wanna grow

I don't ever wanna grow up

I've tried so hard

## 主歌-2

沒有魔術能

能治好我的傷痛

There's no magic trick

to fix the pain I have



而我周遭的一切

感覺都好虛偽

And everything around me

feels as fake as nothing at all



鏡子照不出我真正的自己

而你還是聽不懂

Mirrors can't show me who I'm supposed to be

and you still can't take that hint



你只叫我堅強

需要時跟你發洩

You just tell me stay strong

and talk if I need to

## 導歌

我們心如成駒

你什麼都不用怕

We're strong as horses

you've got nothing to fear



我們心如成駒

閉嘴，我不需要聽

We're strong as horses

don't talk, I don't need to hear

## 重複: 副歌

## 尾奏

我不想長大

我不想長大

I don't wanna grow up

I don't wanna grow up



心如成駒，站直直

As strong as horses we stand tall



我們眼淚如水流

我們眼淚如水流

我們眼淚如水流

Our tears will be waterfalls

Our tears will be waterfalls

Our tears will be waterfalls
