# Regality 君音

我無意識地接受了你種在我身上的聲音。

I unknowingly begot the voice you raised in me.



但你卻反來恨我，只因我成熟後的聲音跟你的有所不同

But you came to hate me, for the voice I cultivated did not resemble yours



當那不願成載你的字句的風兒折返回你

When the wind did not carry your words return



你對著天空嘶吼，以為天空就會為了你分裂

you shouted to the heavens as if they would part for you



而當傳出新的字句時，你鄙視著

And when new words were spoken, you disdained them



「但我是廣大神通」

"But I am great and powerful"
