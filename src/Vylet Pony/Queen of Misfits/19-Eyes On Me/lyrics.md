# Eyes On Me 盯著我

## 前奏

## 主歌-1

看起來你不想繼續盯著

你不想要當個縱火的人

And it looks you wanna break your gaze

you don't wanna be a firestarter



我最近一直要找人輸贏

但你只想找個人來謀殺

Well I've been looking for a fight these days

but you've been looking for another murder



你覺得你能規定我是誰？

我不覺得你有在專心半點

Do you think that you can say who I am?

Well I don't think that you've been paying attention



你覺得你可以全身而退？

Do you think that you can get out without a fight?

## 副歌

你他媽想試，我就給你試

繼續盯著我，盯著我，噢

You can try as you damn well please

keep your eyes on me, eyes on me, oh



而如果你想作弊，我也給你玩

And if you wanna sell out you can hoof da chest



我們的字句相撞

就繼續盯著我，盯著我，噢

And it's my word against yours

so keep your eyes on me, eyes on me, oh



來吧，看著我，瞪著我

Come on and look me and stare me down

## 間奏

## 主歌-2

我就是不能理解你的緣由你的瘋

I just can't understand your motives and your lunacy



這些傷痕比耳邊風還來的

深痛好多

These scars cut deeper than the whispers had

from behind me



電我，看我

揉的歪七扭八

Shock me, watch me

Twist and turn all around me



你覺得你可以隨便

安全地脫逃？

Do you think that you can get out

without consequence?



你覺得你可以眼神看開？

你覺得你可以把我打碎？

So you think that you can draw your gaze?

So you wanna be the one who breaks me?



我經歷過更遭，而你可以入墳再理解

入墳

I've been through worse and you can take that to the grave

The grave



你覺得你是他媽偉大？

你覺得你是個神通了嗎？

So you think that you're so god damn great?

So you think that you're so powerful now?



就想想看跟我一樣，你會怎樣

你活看看

Just imagine what it's like be like to be like me

Live like me
