[CS]

Moon, enlighten the night,

the dark side of light,

I gave you devotion, my blood and my life.

I trusted your stars,

they were once my guide,

but now they are falling along with the...

[PW]

Sun, keeper of flame,

breaker of day,

I gave you my sword, my heart and my faith.

But now the sky is burning,

And I scream and wonder

when did your fire become so (cold)?

[PW]

Cold winds will come like a storm,

[BOTH]

destroying everything, everyone we love.

Time has come to recall,

the days of old,

when both, day and night, were bound by the dawn

[PW]

We are the mountains, the woods, the fields

[CS]

We are the rivers, the shore and the sea

[PW]

What's worth fighting for

[CS]

The reason to win

[BOTH]

our land, our home, the air we breath

[PW]

May thunder be our voice,

[CS]

With lightning in our veins,

[BOTH]

Our hearts our beating power, roaring our claim:

[PW]

"What lives beneath the sun,

[CS]

is written in the stars".

[BOTH]

Why can't you understand?

[BOTH]

One by one, we'll fight

Side by side, we'll fight

Together

[GUITAR SOLO]

[BOTH]

A new day shines, the storm has gone,

May rain wash away all the pain from our souls

Time has come for rebirth,

to rise like the sun,

From now, day and night, will be bound by the dawn
