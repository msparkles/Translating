# Last Ramparts 最後防線

夜裡哭號

，如陰霾

Screams in the dark

Looming shadows stalk the night

Can you hear the bells toll from afar?

Our mission clear and worrisome

Through abyss and pandemonium

And we know...

We might not survive today!

Feel the warming sun just for one last time 'cause

Nothing comes undone, unless we chime in

We'll be strong for the world to see

To end all this insanity!

We ride through

Damnation

The eyes of ruination

Through chaos

And ashes

Withstanding their whiplashes

These tyrants

And heathens

Hellbound to fight those demons

我們不會

We’ll never

Surrender

We are the great defender
