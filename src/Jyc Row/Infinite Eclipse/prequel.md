## 無限日食: 前傳

*原作: Jyc Row - 校正: Radiarc*

*翻譯: Mu_guang_138*

### 夜空之日

這是「無限日食」的第一首歌。

這是 Celestia 的黑暗面—— Daybreaker(破曉之日), 在這個世界觀中的主題曲。

這個轉變的起因仍是未知；大家只知道整件事情發生在午夜，並從中爬出了一位烈焰般的暴君。

很快，Daybreaker 就升起太陽，並製造了首個日食，並且持續了將近兩年。

在這兩年間，Luna 集結了一團軍隊，以對抗 Daybreaker 和她的「日教徒」：一群不曾離開過她身旁，意志堅定的教徒。

### 月之抗爭

在無數個何日教徒的戰鬥後，月教徒們終於到了抵抗 Daybreaker(破曉之日) 的最後一戰。

即使 Luna 得和她的姊姊打上一戰，她仍保持剛柔並濟的領導態度。

她告訴她的追隨者們「不要猶豫」。

抵抗日教徒的戰爭是為了和平跟自由，不計代價。所以他們繼續奮鬥。

雖然月教徒似乎佔了優勢，但最終，Daybreaker 也親臨前線了，而 Luna 也隨之向前站。

最後一次，她讓姊姊看看自己變成了什麼怪物，但 Daybreaker 傲慢地笑著，嘲笑著 Luna, 並開始消滅月教徒眾。

一個接著一個，Luna 的軍隊如日教徒般倒向太陽女神的威能，她壓倒性的力量似乎對她妹妹來說還是太沈重了。

剎那間，Luna 發現一切都結束了，而她的身體也趨近極限。但，從他體內，有個熟悉的聲音喊著她。

她下了個艱難的決定：投降給黑暗，放任它吞噬。

Nightmare Moon(夢魘之月) 重生了。

### 夜之女王

如同夜空之日，這首歌是 Nightmare Moon(夢魘之月) 在無限日食中的主題曲，接在月之抗爭中 Luna 的轉變之後。

兩黑暗姊妹的戰爭開始，他們的力量和對世界的對世界的無情互相抗衡著。

隨著他們倆的相互嘲諷，戰場逐漸變成充滿混亂和毀滅的墳場。

兩邊的信徒都各自支援著各自的領導，就連月教徒也跟隨著他們黑化的公主，但他們很快就發現這已經不是為了和平或自由了。

兩姊妹的眼裡只有毀滅，而任何擋在他們前面的東西都會被馬上解決。

## Infinite Eclipse's Prequel

*Original story by Jyc Row - Proofread and corrected by Radiarc*

### Sun of the Night

This is the first track of the Infinite Eclipse project.

In this universe, this is the theme of Celestia’s dark form, Daybreaker.

The cause for this transformation was uncertain; all that was known was that it happened at midnight and gave rise to a blazing tyrant.

Immediately, Daybreaker raised the sun and provoked the First Eclipse, which lasted approximately two years.

During those two years, Luna sought to gather an army to fight Daybreaker and her Solars, the unwavering cultist followers who never left her side.

### Lunar Rebellion

- EN: TBA

After countless battles against the Solars, the Lunars arrive at the final encounter against Daybreaker.

In spite of Luna having to fight her own sister, she remained a charismatic and thorough leader.

She gave clear orders to her troops to not hesitate.

The war against the Solars was for peace and freedom no matter the cost, and so they fought on.

Although it seemed the Lunars had the high ground, finally, Daybreaker herself emerged, and Luna stepped forward.

One last time, she asked her sister to look at the monster she’d become, but Daybreaker laughed in arrogance, mocking Luna and beginning her assault on the Lunars.

One by one, Luna’s army and the Solars alike fell to the might of the sun goddess, her overwhelming force proving too much for her sister to bear.

It was at that time Luna realized all was lost and her own body was at its limit, but from within, a familiar voice called out to her.

A grim decision was made, and she surrendered, allowing darkness to consume her.

Nightmare Moon lived once more.

### Night Queen

Like Sun of the Night, this track is Nightmare Moon’s theme in the Infinite Eclipse universe, following Luna’s transformation at the end of the Lunar Rebellion.

Battle between the dark sisters began, their power and disregard for the world rivaling the other.

As they taunted and mocked each other, the battlefield turned into a den of chaos and destruction.

The troops of each side came to the aid of their respective leader, even the Lunars fighting by their dark princess, but they quickly realized that this was no longer about peace or freedom.

There was only annihilation in the sisters’ eyes, and anyone or anything in their way would be swiftly destroyed.

### Together, Against the Sisters

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc5XBXdQbw8

The war raged on, but eventually, there came a time when the armies realized the destruction of the sisters was spiraling out of control, and if nothing was done, their world would be a wasteland by battle’s end.

It was then that they set aside their differences and beliefs and joined forces to take down the goddesses.

The Alicorns were annoyed by this betrayal, and further infuriated by their own followers’ determination, fearlessly diving directly into the fray despite the sheer might of the sisters.

Bothered by this unforeseen nuisance, the siblings made a pact to temporarily halt their own rivalry – and redirect their focus on the remaining forces.

The war was long, and many lives were lost.

Very little was left in the wake of this celestial encounter, and the Equestrians still alive were few in number and injured as well.

In the end, however, they vanquished the two demons and brought peace to their world.

A bittersweet victory, yet there was still a place to call home.

The sisters, presumed dead, lied still and beaten on the battlefield, no one sure of what should be done with them.

### Before the Infinite Eclipse

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MThiY6k5hiE

Daybreaker and Nightmare Moon were vanquished by the United Equestrian Pact (the UEP).

The sisters were presumed dead, but the survivors would soon realize all was far from over.

No longer bound to the confines of mortality, they broke free from their former hosts, their mere presence exuding overwhelming power manifesting in raw energy.

As their influence spread, some began to burn, and others were crystallized where they stood -- they were being corrupted in both body and soul.

The sun goddess shined with the brilliance of her past golden armor, her body coursing with magic, her mane and tail ablaze.

The moon goddess similarly glistened in her crystalline form, her dark magic collapsing the ground beneath her into pure diamond.

The transformation was swift, and with it came a gigantic and devastating explosion, either completely annihilating or corrupting most of the remaining forces.

### Final Eclipse

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxsk-DRcacY

Aqasha, the goddess of destruction, and Nerath, the goddess of nightmares have awoken.

Their power returned, they now stand proud and victorious.

All who fell during the battle have been revived, either to become crystalized or molten, blindly following their new leaders.

No longer Celestia or Luna, Daybreaker or Nightmare Moon, they had become the embodiment of nature's wrath, calamity given form.

One with the force of an erupting volcano and the other coursing with the piercing cold of the cruelest blizzard, they stood alongside their followers, transformed far beyond the form their peers once knew.

The dark high-priestesses and the goddesses stood fearless and confident... the final nightmare of the Eclipse has begun.

### Aqasha, Goddess of Destruction

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjvrRXZNfvQ

Aqasha is the Goddess of Destruction, sister and nemesis of Nerath, Goddess of Nightmares.

She has divine power, stronger than an erupting volcano and more cataclysmic than the impact of a thousand meteors.

Her power is based on fire, raw force, and any natural catastrophe.

Her coat is gold in fusion and her mane is a mix between pure fire and magma.

The magic used by a Goddess is pure life-force -- no unicorn alive can wield it, much less fight it.

Being too close to Aqasha will result in being completely turned into ashes in mere seconds.

No one can withstand the presence of a Goddess like Aqasha or Nerath for a long time - they're beings far beyond their alicorn hosts.

While she cannot talk, she has her Voice: the High-Priestess of Destruction, now named Ayzat.

She's the one speaking for the Goddess and controlling their army of Molten - the creatures corrupted by Aqasha, blindly following any order from Ayzat.

Present far before the world existed, the Goddesses were known to no one - they whispered in the mind of their respective High-Priestess that the moment of their awakening had come, after sleeping for more than 25.000 years.

### Ayzat, High-Priestess of Aqasha

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzT9IwN04Rg

Ayzat is the High-Priestess of Destruction and the Voice of Aqasha.

She’s the only one to be able to hear the Words of the goddess directly inside her mind without being overwhelmed by fear, distress and madness.

Her family has been followers of Aqasha since the Ancient Times and was waiting for that day.

When it came, the current scion of the first High-Priestess was Ayzat.

After the resurrection of the two goddesses, Ayzat was changed into a Molten.

However, being the High-Priestess and the Voice of Aqasha made her very different from the Destruction’s army – she now have a very small fraction of Aqasha’s power she just inherited and, compared to Daybreaker, Ayzat knows where the power comes from and can perfectly master it, especially since a goddess’ magic is way different from any other creatures’ magic (the mere essence is different, as a goddess’ magic is pure life-force).

To give a "ratio", Ayzat’s magic abilities are now nine to ten times more powerful than Daybreaker’s.

### Nerath, Goddess of Nightmares

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvuZcKnAgTQ

Nerath, Goddess of Nightmares, is the sister and nemesis of Aqasha.

She's a horrifying divinity and calamity, darker than a moonless night and more terrifying than the worst nightmare one could ever have.

Her power is based on ice, illusion, paranoia and any kind of mind manipulation.

Like her sister, we can't see any form of emotion on her face, her piercing and cold gaze inflicting an unspeakable fear to those who cross it.

Her dark blue fur is covered by crystals of shades varying from purple to royal blue.

Some directly attached to her body, some floating around her.

Her crystal wings were impressive, giving off a kind of whitish aura because of the extremely low temperature coming off of those.

Her tail and mane were pure black, looking like some sort of smoke with some sort of purple-blue shades quite dark, with some infinitely small shards of crystals inside it.

Her slightly dislocated horn was crystalline.

Everything she touches with her hooves is covered with dark blue crystal.

Two small fangs stick out of her mouth.

Nerath is the embodiment of nightmare and terror, which sows madness and feat.

She is inevitable.

### Naegissa, High-Priestess of Nerath

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcMk4QOsuSM

Naegissa is the High-Priestess of Nightmares and the Voice of Nerath.

She’s the only one to be able to hear the Words of the goddess directly inside her mind without being overwhelmed by fear, distress and madness.

Her family has been follower of Nerath since the Ancient Times and was waiting for that day.

When it came, the current scion of the first High-Priestess was Naegissa.

After the resurrection of the two goddesses, Naegissa was changed into a Crystallized.

However, being the High-Priestess and the Voice of Nerath made her very different from the Nightmares’ army – she now have a very small fraction of Nerath’s power she just inherited and, compared to Nightmare Moon, Naegissa knows where the power comes from and can perfectly master it, especially since a goddess’ magic is way different from any other creatures’ magic (the mere essence is different, as a goddess’ magic is pure life-force).

To give a "ratio", Naegissa’s magic abilities are now nine to ten times more powerful than Nightmare Moon’s.

### Last Ramparts

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsVXGvdHdg

An unexpected ancient evil has awoken, something no one could even imagine in their craziest nightmares.

An eclipse was high in the sky, the air was hot and cold at the same time - the battleground was apocalyptic.

But even though the UEP lost a lot of their brothers and sisters, even though they were terrified by the enemy… they didn’t surrender.

They couldn’t, not after all the sacrifices they made.

Out of all the commanders, only five remained: Starlight, Ember, Spitfire, Shining Armor and Thorax.

And even if they didn’t have the biggest army to fight those evils, they will still fight, for their lands and for their lives.

Deep down, they know… Still, they are the last ramparts, they have to buy time to those who can’t fight for them to flee to somewhere safe - if somewhere like that still exist.

### PREQUEL’S FINALE - The Great Divine War

This finale won’t be a song, but HOPEFULLY some sort of mix between an animatic and a comic-dub.

Something a bit similar to "Before the Infinite Eclipse" but with more voice actors, more music and more budget.

I don’t know yet how long it will be or how many parts there will be, but it might be a three-parter.

Considering how huge the project is, it’ll take a lot of time and money to make, so you’ll have to wait a long time before seeing the first part of the final episode of Infinite Eclipse’s prequel (sorry for that).

If you want to support the project and help fund this finale, consider sharing the songs, checking my bandcamp page and subbing to my Patreon - all money gathered with music will directly go to my music projects.

In any case, I hope you’ll like this project.

Once the prequel is finished, I’ll do my best to provide the first book of the main series as soon as possible (by "soon", keep in mind that writing a book is a long task ahah).

Depending on how it goes, and how the budget is doing, this "animatic/comic-dub" project might be different (could be a fic with some songs, or something else).
