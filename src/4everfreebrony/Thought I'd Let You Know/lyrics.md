# Thought I'd Let You Know 希望能讓你知道

## 前奏

## 主歌-1

提筆逐漸變困難

時間也已這麼晚

It's getting hard to write

and late into the night



有好一陣子了，我還在往地上扔信

It's been while now, I toss the mail around



希望你最近過得好

I hope you've been alright

## 主歌-2

我仍急迫想知道

從此我該往何方

I'm eager just to know

where, from this point, I go



我想你也知道，交朋友我都有做到

'Cause I can tell you now, I've made my way around



但我似乎未曾成長

but I never seem to grow

## 副歌-1

若你能看懂這封信件

想必眼淚也會流滿面

If you can see right through this letter

then all the tears are clearly shown



我想就這樣也許更好

但我希望能讓你知道

I guess it must be for the better

but I just thought I'd let you know

## 間奏

## 主歌-3

墨水已快被寫乾

午夜也即將到來

My ink is running out

as midnight comes around



想想也說夠了，我應該寫的都寫了

反正一直都是缺回信

I guess I'll close it up, I think I've said enough

'cause I'm just waiting for you now

## 重複: 副歌-1

## 副歌-2

若你能看懂這封信件 (能看懂我)

想必眼淚也會流滿面 (淚流滿面)

If you can see right through this letter (See right through me)

then all the tears are clearly shown (Tears are surely shown)



就算知道你不會回覆 (永不回覆)

我仍希望能讓你知道 (希望能讓你...)

And still, I know you'll never answer (Never answer)

but I just thought I'd let you know (Thought I'd let you...)
