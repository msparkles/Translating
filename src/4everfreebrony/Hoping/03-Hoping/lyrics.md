# Hoping 希望

## 前奏

## 主歌-1

拯救世界，那又如何

反正它又不會突然消失

I saved a row, even though

I know it won't be taken



我原以為你們不會走

我錯得如此離譜

I thought at first you'd never go

I was so mistaken



大家都說，生命總有終點

I was told life won't last forever



但我已超越了那條界線

But I've gone beyond the marker

## 副歌

他會怎麼做？

會有何感受？

What's one to do?

How's one to feel?



又何去何從

當他沒法打開心胸？

Where's one to go

when their heart won't open?



遠在天邊

卻唾手可及

So far away

Yet so nearby



彷彿誰還在看著

我的一舉一動

Feels as if someone's still

watching over me



所以，我希望

So, here's to hoping

## 間奏

## 主歌-2

如今，我已不想面對

生活的各種驚喜

Nowadays, I pick and choose

my circumstances



我不相信，命運有那

我幻想的第二次機會

I don't believe that fate is up

for giving second chances



如果我沒想錯，時間永不停歇

If I'm right, time goes on forever



感覺還有好多

值得回憶

Feels like there's so much

to remember

## 副歌-2

他會怎麼做？

會有何感受？

What's one to do?

How's one to feel?



又何去何從

當他沒法打開心胸？

Where's one to go

when their heart won't open?



遠在天邊

卻唾手可及

So far away

Yet so nearby



彷彿誰還在看著

我的一舉一動

Feels as if someone's still

watching over me



所以，我...

So, here's to...

## 橋段

...緊握著渺小的希望

緊跟著時間的腳步

...holding on to a little faith

keeping up with the present day



好好珍惜

我的這些朋友們

standing well with

the friends I made



同時確保

我不會就此迷路

and making sure

that I don't lose my way
