# Bound With Time 時間枷鎖

## 前奏

## 主歌-1

我又以為，時間走得快如飛

記憶散去，心也跟著一起碎

Could've sworn the moment just blew away

A heart breaks when memories go to waste



如此真實，卻感覺如此詭異

你應該要知道，我們已被刻進石頭

And it's so real, it's not the way I feel

It's something you should know, our names are marked in stone

## 副歌

除非你的靈魂已被套上－

But not if your soul is bound with-



－時間枷鎖。我一這生中從未有過－

-time. I've never been so lost in my-



－如此失落。即使歲月穿梭我卻還－

-life. Years rolling and I'll still be-



－仍然健在。還是很難接受我這副－

-alive. It's hard knowing that I will never-



－不死之軀。只因靈魂已套上枷鎖

-die. 'Cause I know my soul's been bound with time

## 主歌-2

就算我每天都好好度過

Though I take advantage of every day



分秒必爭，我是怎樣都會輸

every second counts, it's a losing game



沒有終點，這不是我在幻想

And there's no end, it's not just in my head



永遠不能停歇，有些就得說再見

Forever on the line, and some get left behind

## 重複: 副歌

## 橋段

沒想到我的時間線會缺少盡頭

Never knew that my timeline lacked an ending point



也許它會就這樣跟著我繼續走

I imagine it only gets longer as I go

## 樂器獨奏

## 間奏

我的靈魂已被套上－

My soul's been bound with-



－時間枷鎖。我一這生中從未有過－

-time. I've never been so lost in my-



－如此失落。即使歲月穿梭我卻還－

-life. Years rolling and I'll still be-

## 副歌-2

－仍然健在。還是很難接受我這副－

-alive. It's hard knowing that I will never-



－不死之軀。只因靈魂已套上枷鎖...

-die. 'Cause I know my soul's been bound with time...



我的靈魂已套上枷鎖...

My soul's been bound with time...



我的靈魂已套上枷鎖...

My soul's been bound with time...



我的靈魂已套上枷鎖...

My soul's been bound with time...



我的靈魂已套上－－

My soul's been bound with--
