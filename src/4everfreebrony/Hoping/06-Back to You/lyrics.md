# Back to You 回來陪你

## 前奏

## 主歌-1

數不清的歲月

但我總算是回來了

How slowly those years passed

now I'm finally here at last



天知道，我有多想你

Oh heaven knows, I missed you



數不清的夜晚

想著要如何補償你

I spent so many nights

wondering how I'd make things right



才能夠，讓你原諒我

Oh can you please, forgive me

## 導歌

我曾不懂這名為孤獨的痛

I never knew how bad it'd hurt to be alone



一千年過去，我終於可以回家，噢...

It took a thousand years, but now I'm finally coming home, oh...

## 副歌

即使經歷了這麼多

命運仍讓我回來陪你

After all we've been through,

fate has brought me back to you



我們都會變得越來越堅強

We'll be stronger than we've ever been before



即使黑暗蠢蠢欲動

它卻再也沒法吞噬我

And though darkness may creep in,

it won't take over again



因為我再不會離開你了

'Cause I'll be with you forever more

## 間奏

## 主歌-2

我不敢相信是真的

我等到你的回歸了

I can't believe it's true

that I've made it back to you



少了你，我是多麼失落

Oh, I was lost without you



有了你我就滿足

分離絕沒有好處

So happy by your side,

we're better unified



就這樣，持續到永遠

No other way I'd want to

## 副歌-2

即使經歷了這麼多

命運仍讓我回來陪你

After all we've been through,

fate has brought me back to you



我們比以前都還要更堅強

Now we're stronger than we've ever been before



即使黑暗蠢蠢欲動

它卻再也沒法吞噬我

And though darkness may creep in,

it won't take over again



因為我再不會離開你了

'Cause I'll be with you forever more

## 橋段

讓你受傷，我很抱歉

I'm sorry that I hurt you



多少道歉

才能撫平被拋棄的痛

So sorry

that I left you alone



但我想讓你知道

我從今天起之後

But now I want you to be sure

that as we open this new door



會一直留在你身邊

直到永遠

I will be there by your side

forever more
