# Stay 留

## 前奏

## 主歌-1

我總希望，眼裡那串你們的名字

不過是眼睛的惡作劇

I always wished that my eyes were playing tricks on me

whenever I'd see your names



銘刻在那，專雕給你們的石像上

幸好它們不像我這樣

engraved upon stones cut out just for you

At least they're not the same

## 導歌

我每天都會想到你們不在

I'm reminded every day that you're gone



但你能否放過我，就這次？

but could you show a little mercy for once?

## 副歌-1

而你何不留在我夢裡？

而你能否留在這裡

And won't you stay in my dreams?

And don't you ever leave



不要再讓我更加地思念你

Don't make me miss you anymore than I do



你何不留在

我夢裡

Won't you stay

in my dreams

## 主歌-2

不曾想過，我會流落到渴求奇蹟

只因時間有自己安排

I'd never go as far as pleading for a miracle

'cause time has its own mind



但你也該知道，我早已塵封了這些回憶

你們是我最好的發現

But you should know that I've locked up all those memories

'cause you were my best find

## 重複: 導歌

## 副歌-2

所以你何不留在我夢裡？

而你能否留在這裡

So won't you stay in my dreams?

And don't you ever leave



不要再讓我更加地思念你

Don't make me miss you anymore than I do



所以你何不留在

So won't you stay

## 橋段

我夢裡

in my dreams



我曾毫不珍惜這份友誼

I took your friendship for granted



而哦...

and oh...



我真該感激我曾經擁有

I should be grateful I had it



現在看看下場如何

And look what happened

## 間奏

你何不留在我夢裡？

而你能否留在這裡

Won't you stay in my dreams?

And don't you ever leave



不要再讓我更加地思念你

Don't make me miss you anymore than I do



你何不留在

Won't you stay
