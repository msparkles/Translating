# Life Outside 外頭的生活

## 前奏

(4everfreebrony)

應該有這麼個世界

There's a world that should be real somewhere



缺少緊張，愛遍世間

There's a lack of tension and love to spare



真希望我曾經去過

I would tell you that I'd been before



它就在逐夢之門身後

It was just behind the dreamer's door



就在逐夢之門身後

Just behind the dreamer's door

## 間奏

## 主歌-1

(Luna Jax)

如畫般的地和七彩般的天

那兒的景色絕對會你驚豔

Painted hills and colored skies

A wondrous view that simply strikes the heart



(Aviators)

有人負責高掛滿天星

有人負責撐起整片天

There's one who holds the stars in place

Another who keeps it all from falling apart



(P1K)

每天走著一樣的規律

但他們就是這樣

The same routine runs every day

but that's just who they are

## 副歌

(Black Gryph0n)

那堵牆外頭的生活

只希望我曾經夢過

Life outside of the wall

I could say I'd dreamed it



我只要一次，但老實說

我也很難說沒有過

real one time, if at all

I could hardly tell you



會認識誰，會見到什麼

我知道它就在那兒

Who's to know, what you'll find

But it's there, I'm sure



你想要的不過就在逐夢之門身後

What you're looking for is just behind the dreamer's door

## 主歌-2

(MEMJ0123)

有人總是工作到傍晚

有人總能看到你的美

There's one who works until sundown

Another who sees the beauty in everyone



(dBPony)

他呀，把天空視為心肺

這位則樂子永遠找不完

This one takes the sky to heart

The other one knows the best ways to have fun



(Manta Tsubasa)

安靜的她雖還很迷茫

她已找到她的志向

The quiet one's still searching but

she knows who she'll become

## 重複: 副歌

## 橋段

(PrinceWhateverer)

張開眼，自己看

你絕對不會相信

Open up, take a look

You will never believe it



向前進，迎著風

珍惜你眼前所見

Take a step, feel the air

Cherish what you see

## 主歌-3

(4everfreebrony)

有位女孩總想做到最好

There's a girl who wants to do her best



到完美前她都不會睡覺

'Til she has it, she won't stop or rest



不知道它會藏著什麼

Doesn't know just what there is in store



逐夢之門身後有什麼

What there is behind the dreamer's door



就在逐夢之門身後

Just behind the dreamer's door
