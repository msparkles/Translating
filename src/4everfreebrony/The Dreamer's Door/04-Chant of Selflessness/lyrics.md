# Chant of Selflessness 無私之歌

## 前奏

## 副歌

他相信道理簡單明瞭

One would believe in simple means



有人覺得也非不可能

Some would believe it possible



其他人則是漠不關心

Others feel it won't be seen



但沒人相信會有奇蹟

For none believe in miracles



有人用鑽石換碎石

有人用碎石換鑽石

Some give a diamond for a stone

Some give a stone for a diamond



有人守著自己的錢財

而也有人什麼都不說

Some keep all things for their own

And some remain in silence

## 間奏

## 主歌-1

純樸的古代，有位小女孩

皮毛與頭髮如晝夜般

There once lived a girl in a simpler time

with night-like hair and skin so white



不論她到哪，都對大家說

「雖是己所有，爾可當己用」

Wherever she went, everyone she'd tell

"What'd appear as mine, 'tis thine as well"

## 主歌-2

她旅行四方，捐出她所有

從來沒想過要拿回來

So she went through the world, giving all she had

never feeling the need to claim it back



不論她到哪，大家都臣服

「似是己所有，爾可當己用」

Everyone she'd meet would befall her spell

"What appears as mine, 'tis thine as well"

## 主歌-3

雖然她已時日不多

卻仍堅持大方作風

Counting the days of a shortening life

Living the ways of a nursery rhyme



哼聲有如鐘聲一般

雖是己所有，爾可當己用

Humming the tune of a ringing bell

What appears as mine, 'tis thine as well
