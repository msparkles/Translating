# No Different 沒有區別

大家都說月球是每個太空人都夢想去的地方

They say that the moon is a place that every astronaut dreams of going some day



我發覺我也沒有區別。

and I found myself no different.



我也發現孤單可以治好我的忌妒心。

I had also figured that being alone would be the answer to my jealousy.



真是完美。我終於找到了：一個我可以獨處的地方，又不會不知道要幹嘛。

It was perfect. I had found it; the place where I could be alone, but not truly lost.



一個我可以感到開心的地方，即使遠離了朋友；

The place I could be happy while away from my friends;



我可以呼吸自己的空氣，不用跟別人分享。

where I could breathe my own air, sharing it with none.
