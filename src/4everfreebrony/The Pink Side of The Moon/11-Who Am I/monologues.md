# Who Am I? 我是誰？

我是誰？

我怎麼連想都沒想過

我沒有你們的干涉會多麼悲慘，

不開心的事就不想，自己一個人笑？

Who am I?

How could I not even think for a single second

how dismal I would be without your intervention,

prevent unpleasantness and smile lacking your presence?



厭倦一直叫自己思考世間難題

但我也不過是個跳梁小丑

上演一齣影射自己極端的劇；

鬧劇，幌子，真是一齣幻想劇。

Flagging to present myself with the hardest lesson of all

but it's just a fool's errand

projecting a mask of its own rejection;

a farse, a lie of it's own invention.
