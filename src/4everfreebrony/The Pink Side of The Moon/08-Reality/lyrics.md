# Reality 現實

## 前奏

## 主歌-1

分隔的世界

被遺忘的心

Worlds so far apart

hearts hung out to dry



我仍想問好

只望有時間

They'll have my regards

just wish we had time



已經過太久

自從上次見

It's been much too long

since I've their eyes



放手的念頭

我從未想過

Trying to let go

was never on my mind

## 副歌

但誰能從，謊言中分出現實

當每個人看法一致？

But who can tell lies from reality

when everyone sees the same?



誰又能夠，寫下銀河的每一哩

當它就是太多空間？

And who can spell out the miles of the galaxies

when there's just too much space?



而它就是太多空間

And there's just too much space

## 間奏

## 主歌-2

聽好你字句

否則就成玩物

Listen to your words

or they will pass you by



每個人聽見

都會看穿謊言

Everyone who heard

will see right through your lies



想像自己與星群，飄在太空中

的確很簡單

It's not hard to imagine yourself out in space

floating with the stars



但當真的發生時，

在那處境下

But with everything that happens,

happening all around you



你也不再是你

It's just not who you are

## 重複: 副歌

## 橋段

你是否會屏棄你所知一切？

Would you turn your back on everything you know?



並且不往回看，並且不知道去向？

and not look back, and not know where to go?

## 間奏

## 間奏

## 主歌-3

分隔的世界

被遺忘的心

Worlds so far apart

hearts hung out to dry



我仍想問好

他們一直在心上

They'll have my regards

they're always on my mind

## 重複: 副歌

## 尾奏
