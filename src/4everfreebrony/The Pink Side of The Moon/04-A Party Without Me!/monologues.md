# A Party Without Me! 沒邀我的派對！

...哦... 他們怎麼可以！？

我，簡直，不敢，相信！

...oh... HOW COULD THEY!?

I. Can't. BELIEVE IT!!



他們開了派對沒邀我！沒邀 Pinkie!

唉，我—— 誰會這樣做！

They had a party without me! Without PINKIE!

I mean, you-- you just don't DO that!!



哼！

Hmmm!



但管這麼多？講得好像他們得遵守一樣...

But who cares? It's not like they need to follow that rule NOW...



嗯，我，Pinkamena Diane Pie, 定了這些規則。

而如果我，Pinkamena Diane Pie, 不在那邊，那他們就不用遵守規則。

I mean, I, Pinkamena Diane Pie, made the rule.

And if I, Pinkamena Diane Pie, am not there at all, then they won't HAVE to follow the rule.



這是個雙贏。他們在下面很好的話，我在，這邊，也很好！

It's a double-win. They're fine down THERE, and I am fine. Right. HERE!
