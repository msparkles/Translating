# Right Here 就在這

## 主歌-1

我沒有理由沮喪

I have no reason to frown



我不需要轉過身

I don't need to turn around



現在哭還有何用

What's the use in crying now



我不敢相信所見

I can't believe my eyes



我撒了一個瞞天大謊

I told myself the perfect lie



但我現在已不想死掉

But I don't feel like dying now

## 導歌

即使我給自己安排

最厄的運

And even though I turned the odds

against myself



我發現我又再次被

他人所救

Again I find that I've been saved

by someone else

## 副歌

所以今晚，我會改過重來

So tonight, I will make it right



我仍不懂為何

我會想要獨自吞淚

Still I don't know why

I thought I'd swallow all my tears



一直以來，我都想得太歪

All along, I was thinking wrong



我花太久搞清

我所需就在這

It took me far too long to see that

all I need's right here



我所需就在這

All I need's right here

## 主歌-2

有人說我瘋狂

Some say I lost my mind



至少我終於學會了

at least I found it given time



我再也不這樣脆弱

I won't go down so easily



對啦，我知道很明顯

Yeah, it's easy enough to admit



我本來就是不適合

it never was a perfect fit



那月球還是太小了

The moon is just too small for me

所以今晚，我會改過重來

Still I don't know why

I thought I'd swallow all my tears
