# Cry Of The Crystal Slaves 水晶奴隸的哭喊

## 主歌-1

鎖鏈的海溝

約法的繩索

Swimming in chains

Ruled by the reins



沒有人能拒絕他的賭約

No one will say no to his game



驕傲被吞噬

恐懼將支配

Gone is our pride

Fear is our drive



沒有人能拒絕他的雙眼

No one will say no to his eyes



哀傷如山倒

我已難承受

The mountain of sorrow

is much to bear



為何要承受此般負擔

And hard is the burden we share



如要想起身

就要受苦難

And as we build

suffer we will



只要他還在緊盯著我們

as long as we're under his stare

## 副歌

噢，自由，我們將得到自由

噢，自由，我們將跑向自由

Oh, free, freedom to come

Oh, free, free will we run
