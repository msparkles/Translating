# Little Librarian 小圖書館員

## 主歌-1

很久，很久以前

A long, long time ago



兩姊妹統治著萬物

大地上充滿著和平

The sisters ruled in harmony

with solace all throughout the land



你可以好好享受蘋果酒

晚上也不用關門窗

And you could drink your cider there

without the single need to care



大家都是如此和諧

if anypony's looking where you stand



但有天晚上，星星群聚一堂

群眾哭喊著，眼淚流滿大街小巷

But then one night, the stars were calling

The cries were heard and tears were falling



陽光中一道陰影

月光中一張新面孔

Shadows in the sunlight

A new face in the moonlight



預言即將要成真

只有她能拯救眾生

The prophecy was coming true

and only one could see the clues



當她想辦法警告大家時

那魔法就在此開始萌生

But when she tried to spread the news

that's where the magic began



所以－

So--

## 副歌

掰掰，我的小圖書館員

Bye bye, little librarian



別再想了，別再讀了

Stop your thinking, quit the reading



是時候把筆放下了

Drop your numerous pens



照顧好你自己，我們還會相見

And you'll be alright, I know I'll see you again,



你總是說：「我沒你們這群朋友活不下去」

saying "I could never live without friends"



「我沒你們這群朋友活不下去」

"I could never live without friends"

## 主歌-2

你記不記得當初的慘況？

她想讓夜晚持續到永遠

Did you see it all go wrong

as the evening tried to move along



記不記得當初的那道閃電？

and the strike of lightning flashed?



你記不記得和夢魘之月的見面？

你有想到她會那麼快回來嗎？

And did you meet up with Nightmare Moon?

Did you think she'd be back so soon?



噢，事情都發生的好快

Oh, everything was going by so fast



地上傳出一聲巨響

公主也突然消失

A loud clatter filled the atmosphere

when we saw the lady disappear



群眾們都陷入疑惑

但那位聰穎的小馬已有對策

The rest were all confused

but that smart one knew what do



她有著一頭紫色的鬃毛

全科滿分，還有條龍做男僕

She was a pony who had a violet mane

with a straight-A record and a dragon slave



自從那魔法開始萌生

她就變得家喻戶曉

And everypony would know her name

the day the magic began



他們唱著－

They were singing--

## 主歌-3

她曾想著要自己過完人生

鐵石心腸般的難以相處

Now, her whole life, she'd been on her own

with a heart made right out of solid stone



但這就是她曾經的理想

But that's how she preferred to be



但公主告訴她不要總專注在

她只在書上看過的種種

Then the Princess told her to worry less

about things that she had only read



它們不過只是古老的傳說

in a book that contained a mystery



噢，太陽即將要下山

公主也把她送到鎮裡

Oh, and as the sun was going down

the Princess sent her into town



大家都在準備節慶

沒人相信她說的話

Preparing for the feast,

nopony would believe



畢竟過去了一千年

because it had been a thousand years



但午夜已經悄悄來襲

The midnight hour was getting near



那魔法已經開始萌生

公主叫她不要害怕

The Princess told her not to fear

the day the magic began



她也唱著－

## 主歌-4

老舊的城堡裡面喧鬧不停

上演著一齣精采決鬥

Hustle-bustle in an aging castle

It all took off in an epic battle



最後一發將她打飛－－

One last blow and flying faaaaaaaaaaaaast



一切隨著一聲巨響結束

世間又再度回歸了和平

It ended with a powerful blast

The kingdom thrived for a time at last



公主也把她的妹妹拋到腦後

And the Princess put her sister in the past



噢，一分一秒讓人又期待又難過

至少士兵得以好好休息

Oh, the passing hours were bittersweet

while the soldiers kept a safe retreat



他們都忘了她的名字

噢，但這次不會那麼簡單

They all forgot the name

Oh, but it'd never be the same



畢竟元素早已變成石頭

小孩變成大人，童心變得冷淡

'Cause the elements were turned to boulders

Some folks grew old and hearts grew colder



誰會料到那魔法開始萌生

事情就那麼簡單地結束

Who would have thought it'd all be over

the day the magic began?



他們唱著－

They'd be singing--

## 主歌-5

噢，再過幾小時災難就會降臨

六位小馬齊聚一堂

Oh, only hours from certain doom

Six little ponies in one room



已經沒有時間可以浪費

With no time left to waste at all



來吧，告訴他們你的想法

你知道接下來會發生什麼

So, come on, you know something they don't know

You know about the story below



你們之間沒有任何祕密

And secrets are a subtle way to fall



噢，他們穿越一層層黑暗

他們的關係經過一層層試煉

Oh, and as they journeyed through the dark

their hearts were tried and left with marks



就算是地獄的惡魔

也沒辦法打破他們的信任

Nothing from Tartarus

could break their new-found trust



七彩顏色飛向空中

將被詛咒的她給擊退

And as the colors flew into the air

to cast away that cursed mare



隨著那魔法開始萌生

她也從彩虹中站了出來

They found something else that wasn't there

the day the magic began



他們唱著－

他們一起來了場派對

大家一起唱歌跳舞

They had a party back in town,

singing and dancing all around



公主也大駕光臨

They all saw the Princess then



他們再城堡裡找到的友誼

將會繼續流傳千年

What they found in that ancient hall,

they'd not be forgetting soon at all



但那聰明的小馬知道事情都有終點

But the smart one knew the journey had an end



該說的說了，該做的做了

戰爭已經結束，他們取得勝利

And after all was said and done

The war was fought, and the battle won



公主燦爛地笑了

說著：「Spike, 幫我寫下來」

The Princess smiled boldly

and said "Spike, take a note, please"



溫和的聲音，樸實的語氣

她改變了那位小馬的人生

With a calming voice and a simple tone,

she changed the life of the one she'd known



「歡迎來到你的新家」

那天，那魔法也開始萌生

"Welcome to your brand-new home"

the day the magic began



而她也唱著－

And she was singing--
